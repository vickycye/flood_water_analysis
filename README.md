# Welcome!
Once the internship begins, I'll start contributing to this repository.

### Setup Instructions
If you wish, clone the GitHub repository into a remote server (atmos) via VS Code.
1. SSH into the remote server from VS Code--if you open the command palette and don't find the `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host` command, follow these steps:
   1. Install the Remote-SSH extension in VS Code (official extension by Microsoft)
   2. Set up your SSH host in VS Code. Open the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P) and type and select "Remote-SSH: Add new SSH Host...". Then enter the SSH command you normally use, something like `ssh [your username]@[server name]` and choose the default SSH config file `(~/.ssh/config)`. Now VS Code knows about your remote server.
2. Connect to your server via Remote-SSH
   1. Open the command palette and connect to the host, now the window should say `SSH: [server name]`
3. Open a terminal and clone this GitHub repo
   * Run `git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name`
4. Now you can work with files remotely just like locally!
